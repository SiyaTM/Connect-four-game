# Connect-four-game

Let us see who can connect the dots between you and player 2. 

JavaScript is the preferred coding language used for this game.

The coding concepts used were as follows:
.....................................................
.classList.add()
.classList.contains()
.innerHTML()
.length
.onclick()
.querySelector()
.querySelectorAll()
addEventListener()
alert()
.....................................................

Game components:
The game components that were considered within the functionality include:
-Player one
-Plyer two

How it works:
The player that connects four dots in a row, takes the trophy. 

1. Each player will make use of the mouse to place a dot to mark their position. 
2. The aim is for a one of the players to align four dots in a row.  

Launch:
Simply use Visual Studio Code or any HTML/JS/CSS compatible IDE(Integrated development environment) of your choice. 

The code was originally constructed by Ania Kub√≥w of Free code camp. This is used as a basepoint for future adaptions that I aim to make of this game.
